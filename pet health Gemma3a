Pet Health Monitor: Powered by Gemma 3N

A lightweight, offline pet health monitoring system that uses Gemma 3N’s multimodal capabilities to decode your pet’s silent signals—because they can’t tell you when something hurts.

What It Solves

Pets hide discomfort, and traditional monitors (like step trackers) miss critical clues: a dog licking a paw too much, a cat’s quiet whimper, or sudden loss of appetite. This app uses Gemma 3N to connect these dots in real time, even without internet.

Core Features (As Seen in the Demo Video)
Feature How It Works Gemma 3N’s Role 
Multimodal Monitoring Analyzes live video (behaviors) + audio (sounds) Fuses visual/audio data to detect risks (e.g., "paw licking + whimpering → skin inflammation"). 
Offline Operation Runs entirely on your phone Lightweight 4B-parameter Gemma 3N model (optimized via TensorFlow Lite) works without Wi-Fi. 
Conversational Q&A Ask questions like, "Why isn’t it eating?" Uses context from prior analysis + a pet health knowledge base to generate tailored answers. 
Health Records Saves findings for vet visits Tags records with "Gemma 3N Analysis" for traceability. 

Demo in 3 Steps

1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  
2. Run the Full Simulation
Replicates the exact workflow from the video:
python src/pet_health_monitor.py  
3. What You’ll See

◦ Real-time analysis of "paw licking + whimpering"

◦ Gemma 3N’s risk assessment ("Suspected skin inflammation, 92% confidence")

◦ Offline mode validation (works with Wi-Fi disabled)

Technical Breakdown

Model: Gemma 3N (4B Parameters)

• Deployment: Converted to TensorFlow Lite for mobile (uses <2GB RAM).

• Multimodal Pipeline:
# Simplified inference flow (from src/pet_health_monitor.py)  
def analyze_pet(video_frame, audio_clip):  
    # 1. Preprocess inputs for Gemma 3N  
    visual_features = preprocess_video(video_frame)  # 224x224 RGB  
    audio_features = preprocess_audio(audio_clip)    # Mel spectrogram  

    # 2. Run Gemma 3N (core step)  
    result = gemma3n_model.predict(  
        visual_features=visual_features,  
        audio_features=audio_features,  
        prompt="Is this behavior normal? Explain risks."  
    )  

    return result

Why It Matters

• For Pet Owners: Catch issues early (e.g., infections, discomfort) before they worsen.

• For Developers: Shows how to deploy Gemma 3N for edge devices—no cloud costs, no latency.
